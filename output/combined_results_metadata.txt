## Abstract
This file contains parameter estimates (`alpha`, `beta`) and associated variances from nonlinear least squares models applied to mortality-density data collected across multiple reef fish substudies. The dataset supports meta-analysis of density-dependent mortality dynamics in marine fish. Data were generated using the `nls()` function in R and support the findings of a manuscript submitted to *Ecology Letters*.

## Keywords
density dependence, nonlinear modeling, mortality, reef fish, population dynamics, ecological data

## Methods
Mortality data from reef fish substudies were fit using a nonlinear model. Fits were performed in R using `nls()`. The `alpha` parameter estimates density-independent mortality, and `beta` represents the strength of density-dependent mortality. Variances were calculated from model fits or bootstrapped.
